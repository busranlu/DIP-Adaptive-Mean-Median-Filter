# DIP-Adaptive-Mean-Median-Filter
Adaptive Mean Filter, Adaptive Median Filter, Weighted Median Filter Implementations

In this project, three different (Adaptive Mean Filter, Adaptive Median Filter, Weighted Median Filter) filtering algorithms are implemented. These algortihms are tested on salt and paper noise and gaussian noise images (noisyImage_Gaussian.jpg, noisyImage_SaltPepper.jpg) and the results compared with Opencv(cv.medianBlur,cv.blur,cv.GaussianBlur) fuctions. Their PSNR values(with comparing gold standard image(lena_grayscale_hq.jpg, ) are compared.
